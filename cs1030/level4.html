    <p>Me and my dear wife love adventures. You will very rarely find us at home because we love to be outside.</p>

    <p>We both loved kayaking before we got married. I learned how to roll while attending Utah State. She had a an EX boyfriend
        that taught her (lucky guy).After we got married we made an impulsive trip up to Jackson Hole over labor day. While
        we were up there we discovered that the local kayak rental shop was having a liquidation sale. so we bought two kayaks
        and all the gear to go with it. We both agree that it was the best money we have ever spent.</p>

    <p>Backpacking is one of our other secret passions. Every year we hike into the Ryder and Mcpheter Basin up in the High
        Unintahs. The cool crisp air even in the heat of July keeps us coming back year after year. The thrill of adventure
        is what keeps us going through the week.</p>
