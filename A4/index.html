            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>The Weber University Computer Science Program is an organization dedicated to providing WSU students with an informational and social network of individuals interested in computer science. We provide professional resources, including resume
                review sessions, interview preparation, and weekly lunch talks by Weber faculty and industry insiders (BTW, some of are staff ARE industry insiders!).We also foster community among computer science students by way of club-hosted study
                breaks, random outings, and social lunches.
            </p>

            <h3>Many Topics of Study</h3>
            <p>Computer Science is a very diverse field of study. There are many subcultures nested under this subject; we have some who love web design, others who love building and designing software, some love the hardware aspects of computers, and those
                who love building and designing networks. Check out our <a href="#">course catalog</a> to see the wide variety of classes and programs dedicated to learning all about the digital world. You also have the opportunity to come see one of
                our advisors. They have been trained to get you moving and succeeding in the right program.</p>
